### THE MVC by BAYCK

This project was made for the MLH Prime Sping 2016 Finale hackathon.

The MVC is a prototype that uses an Arduino attached to a pair of glasses to translate head movements into cursor controls. To click, keep your head/the cursor still for up to 3 seconds.

For people who have disabilities affecting their hands, the inability to control a computer with accuracy and convenience can have a huge impact on their lives. By using a pair of glasses (a user-friendly and easily produced tool), our hack can provide a light-weight and effective solution to a really harmful problem. Enjoy!
